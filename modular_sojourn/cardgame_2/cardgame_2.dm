	name = "Rules Card"
	desc = "To start the game: Place down a scale or tally system, make sure its balance is at 0.<BR>\n\
	Both players may only have 1 non-fodder deck.<BR>\n\
	The field of play is a (recommended) 4 x 5 grid, players may only play cards on their side of the field unless otherwise noted.<BR>\n\
	At the beginning of the game, both players draw 3 cards + 1 fodder card.<BR>\n\
	After drawing their initial cards, players may place any terrian or blocker cards anywhere on the field.<BR>\n\
	At the beginning of each turn, a player may draw 3 cards, eather fodder or from their deck box, may choice to draw from both i.e 1 fodder 2 main deck. Players draw on their very first turn.<BR>\n\

	Playing Cards:<BR>\n\
	Some cards have an associated blood cost. This cost is paid by sacrificing a total amount of cards on the players field to equal the amount required. Unless otherwise stated, one card is one blood. \
	Any excess blood disappears after a creature is played. You may not sacrifice additional cards while paying a blood cost i.e. if a wolf requires 2 blood, you cannot sacrifice 3 squirrels. \
	If for example you sacrificed one black goat which gives 3 blood to play a wolf that cost 2 blood, the excess amount may not be used for any other purpose and disappears immediately.<BR>\n\
	Some cards have an associated bones cost. Bones are paid by using the counters in the bone pile. When a card is sacrificed or dies it is added to the player's discard pile, the bone pile then \
	gains 1 tally unless otherwise noted. When paying bones, a player must put an equal number of cards back into the deck box it was drawn from equal to the value of bones paid.<BR>\n\
	Blood costs may NOT be paid using cards not on the field or in the discard pile.<BR>\n\
	Bone costs may ONLY be paid using cards in the discard pile. All players share the same bone pile, allowing for bones to be paid using either player's discard counter/bone pile.<BR>\n\

	Attacking:<BR>\n\
	When a player ends their turn, all cards from left to right act. Left to right is determined by the attacking players position.<BR>\n\
	Any card in the back row capable of moving to the first row does so, moving first and then attacking. Cards in the back row cannot attack.<BR>\n\
	Cards deal damage to cards opposite on the board to them. Damage delt in excess to a cards health carries over to the card behind it but NOT the player unless otherwise stated.<BR>\n\
	Cards in the back row cannot attack or move cards in the front row of their side of the field unless otherwise stated, even if that card is a blocker, obstacle, or pelt.<BR>\n\
	When a card dies, it is placed inside the discard pile of the owner of the card unless otherwise stated.<BR>\n\
	If a player were to deal winning or more damage on turn one before the other one is able to play, reset the scale.<BR>\n\
	If the defending player has unblocked, or otherwise attacking cards, that if they were to attack bring the scale below the losing threshhold, adjust scale to be the 1 point away from a loss. Cards in the back row do not move or attack in this calulation.<BR>\n\

	Cards:<BR>\n\
	All cards have health, power, and play requirements noted on the card. Some cards have special effects or rules that are also noted on the card or on the rules card.<BR>\n\
	All cards follow the format of Health/Power. A wolf card with 2 health and 3 power is represented as H2/P3 on the card.<BR>\n\
	Cards must be played first in the back row and only move onto the front row at the end of the owner's turn. Only cards moving into or already present in the front row may attack.<BR>\n\
	If a card has no opposing card opposite to it, the card deals damage the other player.<BR>\n\
	When a player takes damage, the scale or tally system gets moved towards the person equal to the total amount of damage taken, when a player has 5 or more damage, they lose."

	Rivalry - This card loses power equal to the amount of cards sharing the same type currently on the field under that player's control. Each card can only remove 1 power, no matter how many matching \
